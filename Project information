Why Solar Energy?
Climate protection target:
Since 2008, Zurich has long-term energy goals. 
There have been countless policies.
Ready to invest- 430 million Swiss francs per year .
However, 50 %  of primary energy demand is still based on fossil energy sources.

Solar Energy
Solar PV is becoming the lowest-cost option for new electricity generation in most of the world.
But, solar energy in Switzerland only accounts for 0.04% of total energy production. (Source: Bundesamt f√ºr Energy)
And net-zero goals require more than threefold increase in annual capacity deployment.
Thus transition to renewables and solar energy requires greater policy ambition effort from both public and private stakeholders.


Problem Statement
Planning phase:
Identifying suitable locations requires conducting through site assessment. 
High building density and tall buildings limit the area suitable for solar panels.
Intermittent Nature of Solar Power makes it harder to use the excess energy throughout the day.
Execution phase
Need for tailoring per project takes time
Lack of specialized professionals to install solar panels: When placed on the wrong place, they lose 90% of the potential.
Maintenance phase: 
New buildings, climate change etc. impacts the energy production potential and the optimal angle of placement.  
It is hard to track the health status and find professionals to do the maintenance.  


Solution
We identify suitable buildings by doing a solar potential analysis based on open data.
We place the solar panels optimally based on the optimal placement algorithm.
We integrate the analyzed data in a live dashboard, and present optimal solar panel placement recommendations along with cost prediction and available financial plannings.
We provide tailored placement guidelines per project.
Finally we provide a live monitoring system to track the health status and contribution of the solar panels, and suggest actions.
